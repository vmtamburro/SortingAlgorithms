# SortingAlgorithms
This is a program that creates an array of 10,000 random numbers and uses bubble sort, selection sort, and std:: sort to arrange them in ascending order. I also used the clock() function in the std library to time the algorithms and created a seperate table showing the tendancies of these algorithms.
